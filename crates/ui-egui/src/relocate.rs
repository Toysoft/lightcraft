//! Locating a library folder that is somewhere else now, in the app (`folder.locate`; see
//! `lightcraft_engine::relocate`, issue #1112).
//!
//! The person says where the folder is (Synchronize Folder's button when the folder isn't
//! there, or Update Folder Location… on a Folders row). Whether that is the folder is told by
//! looking for the photos' files there, which can take a while on a network share: it runs on a
//! worker thread under a row in the activity stack (its ✕ stops it), and no frame waits for it.
//! Then:
//!
//! * every file is there: the photos are relinked (one undo step, no file touched);
//! * none is: it is not the folder, and a toast says so (the dialog it came from stays open);
//! * only some are (the others are not there, or are not the size the library recorded): a
//!   dialog asks whether to locate the folder there anyway;
//! * a file there is another photo's of the same folder: refused, and a toast says so.
